* CECS 2203, Computer Programming I Laboratory
* Spring 2023, Sec. 06
* Date: March 23, 2023
* Topic: Lab 2 - Methods that return a value, functions
* File name: lab02.cpp
*
* Instructions and problem statement:
* A college professor needs a solution to compute a student's final letter grade.
* Each student has scores for three 100-point exams. The rubric to be used is:
* -If the final grade is greater than 88, the student earns an A
* -If the final grade is greater than 78, but less than 89, the student earns a B
* -If the final grade is greater than or equal to 69, but less than 79, the student earns a C
* -If the final grade is greater than 58, but less than or equal to 68, the student earns a D
* -If the final grade is less than 59, the student is awarded an F
* The solution must first compute a student's final average, after obtaining all three scores.
* The final average will then be submitted to the rubric, and the final output will be the letter grade.
*
* Complete the program by writing the correct C++ statements.
*
* You should execute the program five times to make sure that all letter grades (A,B,C,D,F) are
* possible. Save a screenshot for each instance of the program's execution, and include them in your report.
