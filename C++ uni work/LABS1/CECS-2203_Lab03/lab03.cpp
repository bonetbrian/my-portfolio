* CECS 2203, Computer Programming I Laboratory
* Spring 2023, Sec. 06
* Date: March 30, 2023
* Topic: Lab 3 - Void and value returning methods
* File name: lab03.cpp
*
* Instructions and problem statement:
* The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of Fibonacci numbers. Each Fibonacci number
* is computed by adding the values of the previous 2 Fibonacci numbers. For this
* exercise we will define the first 2 Fibonacci numbers as:
* the Fibonacci number for 0 is 0, and the Fibonacci number for 1 is 1.
* The Fibonacci numbers are only defined for positive integers, which are the values
* greater than or equal to 0. Your solution prompts the user for the number of terms
* in the sequence, computes each Fibonacci number, and prints the corresponding sequence.
*
* Complete the program by writing the correct C++ statements. Execute the program and
* save a screenshot for your report.
