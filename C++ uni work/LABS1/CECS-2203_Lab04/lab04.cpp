* CECS 2203, Computer Programming I Laboratory
* Spring 2023, Sec. 06
* Date: April 13, 2023
* Topic: Lab 4 - Void and value returning methods
* File name: lab04.cpp
*
* Instructions and problem statement:
* In mathematics, the factorial is the product of all positive integers less than and
* equal to the number. For example, the factorial for 3, denoted 3!, would be the
* product 1 x 2 x 3, resulting in 6. Your solution prompts the user for the number which
* the factorial is desired, and prints the correct value.
*
* Complete the program by writing the correct C++ statements. Execute the program and
* save a screenshot for your report.
